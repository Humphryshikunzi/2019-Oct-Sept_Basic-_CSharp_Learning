> ## Getting Started with ClI(Command Line Interface)
```Csharp
 // -o flag for => outputs  
 // loopsandvaribles => foldercreated
 //if not specified uses the name of the current folder you are in.

    dotnet new console -o loopsandvaribles

 // Equivalent to running dotnet build ,dotnet restore and dotnet start 

     dotnet run 

//  Getting the version
    
     dotnet --version
```
